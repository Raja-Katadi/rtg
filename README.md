# rtg
rtg custom file editor bash script

This is a script which allows you to open your file with custom one not just v to open your file with custom one not just vim or nano or so other in termux.

I will also add sponge alike feature in this script;So,no need of moreutils if your are using only for sponge command.



Installing pkg[script]:

1.Goto to a folder in your device and place this file "rtg"

2.Now type command
bash rtg



How to use:

1.Goto to the folder where your file is and follow the video
2.Atlast when you saved the file in custom file editor,click done button now the file is saved.


Note:

1.As of now go to the directory and input the file name,only this works correctly.

2.The files are saved at "linux_bash_temp" directory;You can manually delete that folder if you wish.

3.This is a newbie friendly script but has enough power.
Watch the video completely for further understanding...iyr
